# Fungible

Fungible is a library for updating typed immutable record/map trees in F# via function injection into code which copies said tree. We at BayardRock use it to do dynamic data cleaning of inputs based on our configuration file.

Fungible.Barb is an extension to Fungible to make it work nicely with my [Barb](https://github.com/Rickasaurus/Barb) scripting langugae.
